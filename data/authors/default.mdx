My background is in Mathematics and Computer Science. I earned an engineering degree and a Master’s in Applied Mathematics from Hanoi University of Science and Technology, which shaped my way of thinking – systematic, thoughtful, and patient with uncertainty.

I spent over five years working on digital transformation projects for government agencies, where I learned that real-world impact comes not just from technology, but from understanding people and systems.

Since 2020, I’ve worked in the gaming industry – from online games to Web3 projects. Now, I focus on data and AI-driven solutions to improve game operations and player experience.

Lately, I’ve been exploring management. Not for the title, but to better understand how people work together – in teams, in projects, and in the everyday flow of work.

This website is where I quietly document what I’ve read, learned, and built – a way to make sense of the journey so far.
